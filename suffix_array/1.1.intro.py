# a suffix array is a list of indices sorted according to the lexicographic order of the suffix the beginning of which they indicate.
# it is an alternative to a suffix tree which is an alternative to a trie,
# 
# Longest common prefix array:
# this is an array that contains at each index how many characters the prev and next sorted suffix have in common


# Application of suffix arrays:

# Application of lcp
# no of unique substrings: total number - sum(lcp)
# each element in lcp represents how many repeated substrings there are.
